# TanStack Table Examples
This repository provides working examples for all features we need ([see list](https://support-tech.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PDMY/pages/2701295629/Feature+matrice+per+component)).

It will help us determine how much efforts we must put into a PoC for our future Table component update.

Each example is on its own branch.
